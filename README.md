# Julius-Caesar-Algorithm
Code which encrypts and decrypts a message using the Julius Caesar Algorithm

The Code is a very messy demonstration the Julius Caesar Algorithm. This was a college assignment I ended up making overly complicated for fun :)

I was playing around with main menus and dividing my code into different methods and I failed to plan ahead and the logic got very messy. Therefore I crafted a simpler version (still not the best logic) for my over ambitious and messy coding experiment.

With both codes there is a main menu functionality (I wanted to try out my ideas).

The simple version is called simple_JC_alg and it is probably best select the main menu option 1 for encrypting a message, then copy the cipher text from the encrypted message and select menu option 2 for decrypting a message. This will ask for a cipher text to decrypt. Now paste that copied encrypted message into the console and press enter. The algorithm will print all 26 different key options for decrypting the cipher text. You should see your unencrypted message among the output.

The other version is called Juilius_Ceasar_Algorithm and it was what I submitted to my poor professor. Looking back I feel sorry for him. My idea of fun turned into a messy disaster of over complicating my idea of a menu driven algorithm. 

Enjoy :)
