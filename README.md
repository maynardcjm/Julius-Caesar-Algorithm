# Julius-Caesar-Algorithm
Code which encrypts and decrypts a message using the Julius Caesar Algorithm

The Code is a very messy demonstration the Julius Caesar Algorithm. This was a college assignment I ended up making overly complicated for fun :)

I was playing around with main menus and dividing my code into different methods and I failed to plan ahead and the logic got very messy. Therefore I crafted a simpler version (still not the best logic) for my over ambitious and messy coding experiment.
